LineageOS
===========

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
mkdir -p ~/android/lineage && cd ~/android/lineage
repo init -u https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1.git -b android
mkdir -p .repo/local_manifests
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daviiid99/LineageOS_J5-2015/Manifest/s.xml > .repo/local_manifests/j5.xml
source build/envsetup.sh
repo sync

rm -rf build && vendor/lineage && packages/apps/ThemePicker && packages/apps/Settings && packages/apps/Recorder && packages/apps/Jelly && packages/apps/ExactCalculator

git clone -b android_build https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 build && git clone -b android_vendor_lineage https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 vendor/lineage && git clone -b android_packages_apps_Settings https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 packages/apps/Settings && git clone -b android_packages_apps_Recorder https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 packages/apps/Recorder && git clone -b android_packages_apps_Jelly https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 packages/apps/Jelly && git clone -b android_packags_apps_ExactCalculator https://github.com/daviiid99/S-release1 packages/apps/ExactCalculator
```
